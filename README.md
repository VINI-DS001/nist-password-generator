# NIST Password Generator
The NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) has issued one of the main guidelines for managing passwords. To create this generator I used the ASCII-Table characters, ranging from the 32nd character (Space) to the 126th (~). Here you can see a resume of it's main guidelines which I used to create this password generator.

## Guidelines
- Passwords should be at least 8 characters in length.
- The maximum allowable length of a password must be 64 characters.
- All ASCII/Unicode characters should be allowed, including emojis and spaces.
- Users should be prevented from using sequential characters (e.g., “1234”) or repeated characters (e.g., “aaaa”).
- Complexity requirements — like requiring special characters, numbers or uppercase letters — should not be used.
- Context-specific words, such as the name of the service or the individual’s username, should not be permitted.
